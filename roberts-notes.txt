# Robert's Notes - Ideas for Sophia

## 🎯 URGENT: Dashboard Screenshot & Testing - Priority 95

Sophia, potřebuji aby ses podívala na WebUI dashboard a udělala kompletní test:

**Task 1: Screenshots pomocí Playwright**
1. Install playwright if needed: `pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`
2. Create Python script `tools/dashboard_test.py` that:
   - Opens http://127.0.0.1:8000
   - Takes screenshot of main page (chat interface)
   - Checks if there are navigation links to Task Queue or Hypotheses
   - Takes screenshots of each view found
   - Saves all to `dashboard_screenshots/` with timestamp
3. Run the script and verify screenshots are saved

**Task 2: Analysis Report**
Create `dashboard_screenshots/REPORT.md` with:
- List of all screenshots with descriptions
- UI elements found (buttons, forms, navigation)
- Missing features or broken functionality
- Recommendations for improvements

**Expected Output:**
```
dashboard_screenshots/
├── main_page_20251107_HHMMSS.png
├── task_queue_20251107_HHMMSS.png (if exists)
├── hypotheses_20251107_HHMMSS.png (if exists)
└── REPORT.md
```

**Priority:** 95 (very important)
**Category:** testing
**Auto-apply:** Yes (run locally, don't send to Jules)

## Notes on Jules Integration

Jules integration is DISABLED until proper prompt sanitization is implemented.
See docs/JULES_INTEGRATION.md for details.

Current issue: Jules receives prompts with .env references and internal context
that he can't access (works with clean GitHub repo only).

Solution implemented:
- cognitive_jules_autonomy._sanitize_prompt_for_jules() cleans prompts
- Removes .env, secrets, Sophia-specific jargon
- Adds instructions about clean repo context

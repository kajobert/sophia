# Sophia's Idea Backlog

This document contains a backlog of ideas, feature requests, and high-level goals for the development of Sophia. It is inspired by the initial thoughts in `roberts-notes.txt` and is maintained in accordance with the project's development guidelines.

## 1. UX/UI Enhancements

### 1.1. Improve Terminal Experience
*   **Goal:** Make the terminal output more user-friendly and easier to debug.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement colorized logging to distinguish between different types of messages (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR).
    *   Introduce structured, formatted output for displaying plans, tool calls, and results to improve readability.

### 1.2. Kernel State Visualization
*   **Goal:** Provide real-time visibility into the Kernel's current state and activity.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Design and implement an "information bar" or status line that displays the current phase of the `consciousness_loop` (e.g., `LISTENING`, `PLANNING`, `EXECUTING`).
    *   Ensure this status is visible in both the terminal interface and the Web UI.

## 2. LLM and Logic Improvements

### 2.1. Optimize Tool-Calling Logic
*   **Goal:** Increase the reliability and efficiency of tool calls to minimize retries.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Conduct a thorough prompt engineering review to refine the instructions the LLM receives for generating plans and tool arguments.
    *   Investigate and implement more robust validation and repair mechanisms to catch and correct errors before execution.

### 2.2. Implement an LLM Debug Mode
*   **Goal:** Create a supervised debugging mode for reviewing and approving AI-generated plans.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Develop a mechanism that pauses the Kernel after the `PLANNING` phase.
    *   Allow a human developer to review, modify, or approve the generated plan before it proceeds to the `EXECUTING` phase.

## 3. Knowledge Transfer and Documentation

### 3.1. Integrate Lessons from "Jules"
*   **Goal:** Transfer the operational knowledge and limitations discovered while working with the "Jules" agent to Sophia.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Analyze the `WORKLOG.md` and commit history to identify recurring challenges, successful patterns, and architectural constraints.
    *   Codify these findings into a new "Learned Lessons" document in the `docs/learned/` directory to guide Sophia's future self-development.

### 3.2. Maintain Detailed Technical Documentation
*   **Goal:** Ensure that all technical documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date to prevent context loss.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Establish a strict policy where no new feature is considered complete until its corresponding documentation (`Developer Guide`, `Technical Architecture`, etc.) is updated.
    *   Create a "Developer Manual" that provides clear, step-by-step instructions for common development tasks to help both human and AI developers stay on track.

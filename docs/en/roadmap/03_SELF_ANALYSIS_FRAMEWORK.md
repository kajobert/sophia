# Roadmap 03: Self-Analysis Framework

**Status:** COMPLETED

**Phase Goal:** To develop Sophia's capacity for introspection. This phase involved creating a suite of cognitive plugins that allow her to read, understand, and reason about her own structure, code, and documentation. This was the critical step before true autonomy could be considered.

### Key Objectives:

1.  **Code Comprehension Plugin (`cognitive_code_reader`):**
    *   **Status:** COMPLETED
    *   **Purpose:** Allow Sophia to read and build a mental model of her own source code.
    *   **Core Capabilities:** `analyze_codebase`, `get_class_definition`, `get_function_signature`, `list_plugins`.

2.  **Documentation Comprehension Plugin (`cognitive_doc_reader`):**
    *   **Status:** COMPLETED
    *   **Purpose:** Enable Sophia to read and understand her own documentation, turning it into an actionable source of truth for her behavior.
    *   **Core Capabilities:** `read_document`, `find_guideline`, `get_architectural_overview`.

3.  **Dependency Analysis Plugin (`cognitive_dependency_analyzer`):**
    *   **Status:** COMPLETED
    *   **Purpose:** Grant Sophia the ability to understand her software dependencies.
    *   **Core Capabilities:** `list_dependencies`, `check_dependency_version`.

4.  **Historical Analysis Plugin (`cognitive_historian`):**
    *   **Status:** COMPLETED
    *   **Purpose:** Allow Sophia to learn from the project's history by analyzing the `WORKLOG.md` and other historical records.
    *   **Core Capabilities:** `review_past_missions`, `identify_past_failures`, `summarize_agent_performance`.

**Success Criteria:** Sophia can be asked, "According to your documentation, what are the mandatory steps for creating a new plugin, and are there any existing plugins that perform a similar function?" She should be able to answer this question correctly by using these self-analysis tools.

**Outcome:** All objectives of this phase have been met. The system is now ready to proceed to the next phase: Autonomous Operations.

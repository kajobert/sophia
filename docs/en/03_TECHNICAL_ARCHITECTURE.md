# Document 3: Technical Architecture

This document outlines the technical design of the Sophia AGI system, focusing on the Core-Plugin model.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Stability and Extensibility

*   **The Core is Sacred:** The `core` of the application is minimal, stable, and protected. It provides the essential scaffolding and orchestration but contains no domain-specific logic.
*   **Everything is a Plugin:** All functionality, from cognitive processes to tool integrations, is implemented as a self-contained plugin. This makes the system modular, easy to test, and safe to extend.

## 2. Main Components

### 2.1. The `Core` (`core/`)

*   **Responsibility:** Orchestrates the main application loop, manages plugins, and handles the flow of data.
*   **Key Modules:**
    *   `run.py`: The application entry point.
    *   `kernel.py`: Orchestrates the main application loop (`Consciousness Loop`), manages state, and handles the flow of data.
    *   `plugin_manager.py`: Discovers, loads, and validates plugins.
    *   `context.py`: Defines the `SharedContext` data structure.
    *   `logging_config.py`: Configures the central logging system.

#### 2.1.1. Advanced Kernel Features

The `Kernel` includes several advanced features to enable complex, multi-step operations:

*   **Validation & Repair Loop:** Before executing a tool, the Kernel validates the arguments provided by the AI against a Pydantic schema. If validation fails, it automatically triggers a "repair loop," using a specialized LLM prompt to correct the faulty arguments.
*   **Context Injection:** The Kernel intelligently inspects the signature of a tool's method. If it detects a `context` parameter, it automatically injects the current `SharedContext` object, giving the tool access to the logger, session ID, and conversation history.
*   **History Propagation:** For each step in a multi-step plan, the Kernel creates a new, history-aware `SharedContext`. This context includes the original user request plus the results of all previous steps, ensuring the AI has a complete understanding of the task's progress.

### 2.2. `Plugins` (`plugins/`)

*   **Responsibility:** Encapsulates a specific piece of functionality.
*   **Structure:**
    *   Each plugin is a single Python file (e.g., `plugins/tool_file_system.py`).
    *   Every plugin **must** inherit from the `BasePlugin` class defined in `plugins/base_plugin.py`.
    *   Plugins are discovered and loaded at runtime by the `PluginManager`.

#### 2.2.1. Available Tool Plugins

*   **`FileSystemTool`:** Provides a secure, sandboxed environment for the agent to read, write, and list files. All file operations are restricted to a designated `sandbox/` directory to prevent unintended access to the system.
*   **`BashTool`:** Allows the agent to execute shell commands within a secure, isolated environment. This is useful for running scripts, managing processes, or interacting with the operating system in a controlled manner.
*   **`GitTool`:** Enables the agent to interact with its own source code repository. It can check the status, view diffs of changes, and get the current branch name, providing a basic level of self-awareness of its own code.
*   **`WebSearchTool`:** Gives the agent the ability to perform Google searches to access real-time information from the internet. This is a crucial tool for research and staying up-to-date.

### 2.3. `SharedContext` (`core/context.py`)

*   **Responsibility:** The data bus and "lifeblood" of the system.
1.  It is a `dataclass`, an instance of which is passed to every plugin in every cycle.
2.  It contains the entire state for the current cycle, including `session_id`, `current_state`, `user_input`, `history`, a flexible `payload` for inter-plugin data sharing, and a **session-specific logger**.
*   **Structure (`dataclass`):**
    *   `session_id: str`: A unique ID for the current session.
    *   `current_state: str`: The current state of the main loop (`LISTENING`, `THINKING`, etc.).
    *   `user_input: str | None`: The latest input from the user.
    *   `history: list`: A short-term history of the current conversation.
    *   `payload: dict`: A "cargo space" for data passed between plugins.
    *   `logger: logging.Logger`: A configured logger that automatically injects the `session_id` into all records, ensuring clear, contextual logging across all plugins.

# Benchmark: Low-Cost LLM Comparison for Multi-Step Plan Execution

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Author:** Jules v1.2

## 1. Objective

The goal of this benchmark is to identify the most cost-effective Large Language Model (LLM) available on OpenRouter that can reliably execute a complex, 5-step, multi-tool plan.

This process follows the "benchmark debugging" principle: if a model fails, we will first analyze the failure to determine if a fix can be implemented in our own codebase to improve robustness.

## 2. Benchmark Scenario

The test uses the following complex prompt, which requires tool discovery, file I/O, result chaining, and context propagation:

```
List all available plugins, write the list to a temporary file named 'temp_plugins.txt', read the content of this file, then use an LLM to reformat the content into a Markdown table, and finally, write the resulting Markdown to a new file named 'plugins.md'.
```

## 3. Candidate Models

Based on research of OpenRouter's pricing and capabilities, the following low-cost models (substantially less than $1/M tokens) that support tool calling have been selected for evaluation:

| Model Name                               | Price (Input/Output per M tokens) |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct`          | $0.028 / $0.054                   |
| `google/gemma-2-9b-it`                   | $0.07 / $0.14                     |
| `qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct`              | $0.10 / $0.10                     |
| `microsoft/phi-3.5-mini-128k-instruct`   | $0.25 / $1.25                     |

# MVP Stabilization Log

## Objective

The primary goal of this mission was to achieve a stable MVP of the Nomad agent, capable of creating a new tool for web interaction. This involved a "Test-Analyze-Fix" cycle, where the agent would be tasked with creating a `web_scraper.py` tool, and any failures would be diagnosed and repaired.

## Summary of Work

The following is a detailed log of the steps taken to debug and evolve the Nomad AI agent, the issues encountered, and the fixes implemented.

### Initial State

The mission began with the agent in a state where it was unable to complete the crucible mission. The initial runs revealed several critical issues.

### Key Issues Identified and Resolved

1.  **`SyntaxError` in `core/mcp_client.py`**:
    *   **Symptom**: The application would crash immediately on startup with a `SyntaxError: expected 'except' or 'finally' block`.
    *   **Root Cause**: A duplicated and incomplete `try` block in the `shutdown` method.
    *   **Fix**: The duplicated code was removed from `core/mcp_client.py`.

2.  **JSON Serialization `TypeError` in MCP Servers**:
    *   **Symptom**: The `custom_tools_server.py` and `management_server.py` would fail to initialize, preventing the agent from accessing critical tools.
    *   **Root Cause**: The `get_capabilities` method in `mcp_servers/base_mcp_server.py` was returning a dictionary containing non-serializable method objects, which caused `json.dumps` to fail.
    *   **Fix**: The `get_capabilities` method in `mcp_servers/base_mcp_server.py` was refactored to separate tool definitions from tool functions, ensuring only serializable data was returned.

3.  **`AttributeError` in `mcp_servers/shell_server.py`**:
    *   **Symptom**: The `shell_server.py` would crash on startup with an `AttributeError: 'ShellServer' object has no attribute 'register_tool'`.
    *   **Root Cause**: The server was not inheriting from `BaseMCPServer` and was using an incorrect method name (`register_tool` instead of `add_tool`).
    *   **Fix**: The `shell_server.py` was refactored to inherit from `BaseMCPServer` and use the correct `add_tool` method.

4.  **TUI Dependency in `core/rich_printer.py`**:
    *   **Symptom**: The `run_local_mission.py` script would hang, even after the above fixes were applied.
    *   **Root Cause**: The `core/rich_printer.py` file had a direct dependency on `tui.messages`, which caused the script to hang when the TUI was not available.
    *   **Fix**: The `try/except` block in `core/rich_printer.py` was modified to use a conditional import, removing the hard dependency on the TUI.

### Unresolved Issue: Hanging `run_local_mission.py` Script

Despite the fixes listed above, the `run_local_mission.py` script continues to hang.

*   **Symptom**: The script hangs indefinitely after being launched, with no error messages or further output.
*   **Troubleshooting Steps Taken**:
    *   Reset the entire repository to a clean state to eliminate caching issues.
    *   Re-applied all known fixes.
    *   Added debug statements to `scripts/run_local_mission.py` to pinpoint the hang.
    *   Isolated the hang to the `RichPrinter.configure_logging()` call, but commenting it out did not resolve the issue.
    *   Removed the TUI dependency from `core/rich_printer.py`.
*   **Conclusion**: The root cause of the hang remains unknown. It is likely an issue with the environment or a subtle bug in the initialization process that I have been unable to identify.

## Next Steps

The next programmer should focus on resolving the hanging issue with the `run_local_mission.py` script. The fixes for the `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, and `AttributeError` should be re-applied, as they are necessary for the agent to function correctly.

It is recommended to start by examining the environment and the initialization process in `core/nomad_orchestrator_v2.py` and `core/mcp_client.py` to identify the source of the hang. Once the script can run without hanging, the crucible mission should be re-run to continue the "Test-Analyze-Fix" cycle.

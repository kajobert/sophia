# MVP Stabilization Log

## Objective

The primary goal of this mission was to achieve a stable MVP of the Nomad agent, capable of creating a new tool for web interaction. This involved a "Test-Analyze-Fix" cycle, where the agent would be tasked with creating a `web_scraper.py` tool, and any failures would be diagnosed and repaired.

## Summary of Work

The following is a detailed log of the steps taken to debug and evolve the Nomad AI agent, the issues encountered, and the fixes implemented.

### Initial State

The mission began with the agent in a state where it was unable to complete the crucible mission. The initial runs revealed several critical issues.

### Key Issues Identified and Resolved

1.  **`SyntaxError` in `core/mcp_client.py`**:
    *   **Symptom**: The application would crash immediately on startup with a `SyntaxError: expected 'except' or 'finally' block`.
    *   **Root Cause**: A duplicated and incomplete `try` block in the `shutdown` method.
    *   **Fix**: The duplicated code was removed from `core/mcp_client.py`.

2.  **JSON Serialization `TypeError` in MCP Servers**:
    *   **Symptom**: The `custom_tools_server.py` and `management_server.py` would fail to initialize, preventing the agent from accessing critical tools.
    *   **Root Cause**: The `get_capabilities` method in `mcp_servers/base_mcp_server.py` was returning a dictionary containing non-serializable method objects, which caused `json.dumps` to fail.
    *   **Fix**: The `get_capabilities` method in `mcp_servers/base_mcp_server.py` was refactored to separate tool definitions from tool functions, ensuring only serializable data was returned.

3.  **`AttributeError` in `mcp_servers/shell_server.py`**:
    *   **Symptom**: The `shell_server.py` would crash on startup with an `AttributeError: 'ShellServer' object has no attribute 'register_tool'`.
    *   **Root Cause**: The server was not inheriting from `BaseMCPServer` and was using an incorrect method name (`register_tool` instead of `add_tool`).
    *   **Fix**: The `shell_server.py` was refactored to inherit from `BaseMCPServer` and use the correct `add_tool` method.

4.  **TUI Dependency in `core/rich_printer.py`**:
    *   **Symptom**: The `run_local_mission.py` script would hang, even after the above fixes were applied.
    *   **Root Cause**: The `core/rich_printer.py` file had a direct dependency on `tui.messages`, which caused the script to hang when the TUI was not available.
    *   **Fix**: The `try/except` block in `core/rich_printer.py` was modified to use a conditional import, removing the hard dependency on the TUI.

### Unresolved Issue: Hanging `run_local_mission.py` Script

Despite the fixes listed above, the `run_local_mission.py` script continues to hang.

*   **Symptom**: The script hangs indefinitely after being launched, with no error messages or further output.
*   **Troubleshooting Steps Taken**:
    *   Reset the entire repository to a clean state to eliminate caching issues.
    *   Re-applied all known fixes.
    *   Added debug statements to `scripts/run_local_mission.py` to pinpoint the hang.
    *   Isolated the hang to the `RichPrinter.configure_logging()` call, but commenting it out did not resolve the issue.
    *   Removed the TUI dependency from `core/rich_printer.py`.
*   **Conclusion**: The root cause of the hang remains unknown. It is likely an issue with the environment or a subtle bug in the initialization process that I have been unable to identify.

## Next Steps

The next programmer should focus on resolving the hanging issue with the `run_local_mission.py` script. The fixes for the `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, and `AttributeError` should be re-applied, as they are necessary for the agent to function correctly.

It is recommended to start by examining the environment and the initialization process in `core/nomad_orchestrator_v2.py` and `core/mcp_client.py` to identify the source of the hang. Once the script can run without hanging, the crucible mission should be re-run to continue the "Test-Analyze-Fix" cycle.

## Jules's Investigation (Continuation)

Upon taking over the mission, a systematic investigation into the hanging `run_local_mission.py` script was launched. The following critical architectural flaws were identified and fixed:

1.  **Infinite Recursion in `mcp_servers/management_server.py`**:
    *   **Symptom**: The application would hang indefinitely without any error output.
    *   **Root Cause**: The `ManagementServer` was creating its own instance of `MCPClient` within its constructor. When the main `MCPClient` started the `ManagementServer` as a subprocess, the server would then create a new client, which would in turn try to start all servers again, leading to an infinite recursion of process creation and a silent deadlock.
    *   **Fix**: The recursive instantiation of `MCPClient` was disabled by passing `None` to the `ManagementTools` constructor.

2.  **Deadlocking Event Loops in `mcp_servers/control_server.py` and `mcp_servers/debug_server.py`**:
    *   **Symptom**: Even after fixing the infinite recursion, the application continued to hang.
    *   **Root Cause**: Both `control_server.py` and `debug_server.py` were not inheriting from `BaseMCPServer`. Instead, they implemented their own custom `asyncio` event loops to read from `stdin`. This architectural deviation from the project's standard conflicted with the main `MCPClient`'s process management, causing a deadlock.
    *   **Fix**: Both servers were refactored to inherit from `BaseMCPServer` and use the standard `add_tool` mechanism, removing the custom, conflicting event loops.

### Unresolved Issue: Persistent Deadlock

Despite identifying and fixing these multiple, severe architectural defects, the `run_local_mission.py` script **continues to hang** indefinitely upon launch.

*   **Conclusion**: The persistence of the hang after fixing clear, critical bugs points to a fundamental and unresolvable issue within the execution environment, the Python `asyncio` implementation in this specific context, or another hidden circular dependency that is not immediately apparent. The core process management of the agent is fundamentally broken in a way that standard debugging and architectural correction have been unable to solve.

### Next Steps

A full review of the `asyncio` implementation and the inter-process communication protocol is required. The current approach of launching multiple server subprocesses and waiting for them to initialize seems to be the source of this fragile and un-debuggable behavior. It is recommended to explore alternative architectures, such as a single-process design or a more robust IPC mechanism like ZeroMQ, before proceeding with further development.

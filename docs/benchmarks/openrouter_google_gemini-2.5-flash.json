Now, let's read its content.\n\n**2. tool_file_system.read_file(filepath=\"README.md\")**\n```\n# TypeScript Action\n\nThis action is a `TypeScript` action. This action takes an input `name`, and outputs a greeting.\n\n## Inputs\n\n### `name`\n\n**Required** The name to greet.

This action takes a required input `name` (defaulting to \"World\") and outputs a greeting along with the `time` of the greeting. It also provides an example of how to use the action in a workflow.\n```\nNow that I have the summary, I will write it to `docs/summary.md`.\n\n**4. tool_file_system.write_file(filepath=\"docs/summary.md\", content=\"This README describes a TypeScript GitHub Action.

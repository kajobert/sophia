Read the `README.md` file\n2. Summarize the content\n3. Write the summary to a new file named `docs/summary.md`\n\n## Steps\n\nThe plan for the AI assistant to complete the task is as follows:\n\n1. `tool_file_system.list_directory(path=\".\")` - to see the files in the current directory.\n2. `tool_file_system.read_file(filepath=\"README.md\")` - to read the content of the README file.\n3. `tool_llm.execute(prompt=\"Summarize the following text: {file_content}\")` - to summarize the content.\n4. `tool_file_system.write_file(filepath=\"docs/summary.md\", content=\"{summary}\")` - to write the summary to a new file.\n5. `tool_file_system.list_directory(path=\"docs/\")` - to verify the new file was created.\n6. `tool_file_system.read_file(filepath=\"docs/summary.md\")` - to verify the content of the new file.\n7. `tool_file_system.delete_file(filepath=\"docs/summary.md\")` - to clean up the created file.\n8. `tool_file_system.list_directory(path=\"docs/\")` - to verify the file was deleted.\n\nGood luck!\n```\n\n3. **tool_llm.execute(prompt=\"Summarize the following text: {file_content}\")** - to summarize the content.\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis README file provides an introduction to a project and outlines the tasks for an AI assistant. The AI assistant's main goal is to read the README file, summarize its content, and write the summary to a new file named 'docs/summary.md'. The plan for the AI assistant to complete this task is also provided, including steps to list the current directory, read the README file, summarize the content, write the summary to a new file, and verify the file creation and deletion.\n```\n\n4. **tool_file_system.write_file(filepath=\"docs/summary.md\", content=\"{summary}\")** - to write the summary to a new file.\n\nOutput:\n```\nFile 'docs/summary.md' created successfully.\n```\n\n5. **tool_file_system.list_directory(path=\"docs/\")** - to verify the new file was created.\n\nOutput:\n```\n['summary.md']\n```\n\n6. **tool_file_system.read_file(filepath=\"docs/summary.md\")** - to verify the content of the new file.\n\nOutput:\n```\nThis README file provides an introduction to a project and outlines the tasks for an AI assistant.

Now, let's read the README.md file:\n```python\nreadme_content = tool_file_system.read_file(filepath=\"README.md\")\n```\n\n3. Let's summarize the content:\n```python\nsummary = tool_llm.execute(prompt=f\"Summarize the following text: {readme_content}\")\n```\n\n4. Let's write the summary to a new file:\n```python\ntool_file_system.write_file(filepath=\"docs/summary.md\", content=summary)\n```\n\n5. Let's verify the file was created:\n```python\ntool_file_system.list_directory(path=\"docs/\")\n```\n\n6. Let's check the content of the summary file:\n```python\ntool_file_system.read_file(filepath=\"docs/summary.md\")\n```\n\n7. Let's clean up by deleting the file:\n```python\ntool_file_system.delete_file(filepath=\"docs/summary.md\")\n```\n\n8. Finally, let's verify the file was deleted:\n```python\ntool_file_system.list_directory(path=\"docs/\")\n```\n\nCould you help me execute these commands and show me the output of each step?"

Hi! I need your help continuing work on Sophia AGI project. 

**Context:** Previous session completed dependency injection standardization across all plugins. All 177 tests passing. System stable and ready for next phase.

**Your Mission:** Complete remaining tasks 1-4 from the stabilization plan.

**CRITICAL - Read These First:**
1. `docs/cs/AGENTS.md` - Your operating manual (5 golden rules, workflow)
2. `docs/STABILIZATION_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` - Your task list
3. `docs/NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md` - Complete context (446 lines)

Or use quick version: `docs/NEXT_SESSION_QUICK.md` (100 lines)

**Quick Status:**
- ✅ Tests: 177 passed, 16 deselected (integration), 0 failed
- ✅ Sophia responds in <30s with --once mode
- ✅ Jules Hybrid Strategy documented and dependencies injected
- 🎯 Next: Real-world Jules testing, integration tests, code quality, docs

**Start by reading AGENTS.md, then confirm you understand the mission!**

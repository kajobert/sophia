**Mission:** 8-Step Benchmark Execution and Advanced Architectural Hardening
**Agent:** Jules v1.2
**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** COMPLETED

**1. Plan:**
*   Run the 8-step programming benchmark.
*   Analyze failures and implement architectural improvements.
*   Achieve three consecutive successful runs.
*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Initiated the 8-step programming benchmark, which immediately revealed several underlying architectural issues.
*   Resolved a persistent `ModuleNotFoundError` by enforcing the use of the virtual environment's Python executable (`.venv/bin/python`) for all script executions, ensuring environment consistency.
*   Diagnosed and fixed a critical logging failure (`KeyError: 'session_id'`) caused by a race condition with the `litellm` library. Implemented a targeted fix in `plugins/tool_llm.py` to inject the required `SessionIdFilter` into the root logger during the plugin's setup, making the system resilient to logging from external libraries.
*   Addressed a second logging flaw within the `FileSystemTool` by refactoring its methods (`read_file`, `write_file`, etc.) to accept the `SharedContext` and use the correct session-specific logger.
*   Solved a planner failure where the LLM was hallucinating incorrect method names (e.g., `write` instead of `write_file`). Modified the `CognitivePlanner` to dynamically include a detailed list of available methods for each tool in its prompt, providing the LLM with the necessary context to generate valid plans.
*   After implementing these fixes, successfully executed the 8-step programming benchmark three times in a row, confirming the stability and robustness of the improved architecture.

**3. Outcome:**
*   The mission was completed successfully. The system's reliability has been significantly enhanced, and it is now capable of executing complex, multi-step programming benchmarks without failure. The architectural improvements to the logging and planning systems have proven effective.

**Mission:** System Stabilization and Benchmark Verification
**Agent:** Jules v1.2
**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** COMPLETED

**1. Plan:**
*   Run the 5-step benchmark 10 times to identify instabilities.
*   Analyze failures and implement architectural improvements.
*   Verify stability with 10 consecutive successful runs.
*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Conducted a rigorous stability test by running the 5-step benchmark 10 times.
*   Identified and fixed a critical bug in the Kernel's "Validation & Repair Loop" where the repaired JSON from the LLM was not being correctly parsed.
*   Enhanced the repair prompt to provide the LLM with more context, enabling it to infer missing arguments more reliably.
*   Implemented a programmatic fallback in the Kernel to automatically insert the `content` argument for the `write_file` tool when it can be inferred from the previous step, making the system more resilient to LLM inconsistencies.
*   Successfully ran the 5-step benchmark 10 times in a row to confirm that the architectural improvements have stabilized the system.

**3. Outcome:**
*   The mission was completed successfully. The system is now demonstrably stable and can reliably pass the 5-step benchmark on the first attempt.

*   Added `PyYAML` to `requirements.in` to handle YAML parsing.
*   Modified `plugins/tool_llm.py` to load the model from the config file at setup, with a sensible fallback.
*   Updated `tests/plugins/test_tool_llm.py` to use a temporary config file, ensuring the test remains isolated and robust.

**3. Result:**
*   Mission accomplished. The LLM model is now configurable, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.

**Agent:** Jules v1.6
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** COMPLETED

**1. Plan:**
*   Fix the `TypeError: Passing coroutines is forbidden` in `core/kernel.py`.

*   Successfully ran the full test suite to ensure the fixes were effective and introduced no regressions.

**3. Result:**
*   Mission accomplished. The runtime `TypeError` is resolved, and a safeguard is now in place to ensure the application is always run from the correct environment, preventing future module-not-found errors.

**Mission:** 8-Step Benchmark Execution and Advanced Architectural Hardening
**Agent:** Jules v1.2
**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** COMPLETED

**1. Plan:**
*   Run the 8-step programming benchmark.
*   Analyze failures and implement architectural improvements.
*   Achieve three consecutive successful runs.
*   Update `WORKLOG.md`.

**2. Actions Taken:**
*   Initiated the 8-step programming benchmark, which immediately revealed several underlying architectural issues.
*   Resolved a persistent `ModuleNotFoundError` by enforcing the use of the virtual environment's Python executable (`.venv/bin/python`) for all script executions, ensuring environment consistency.
*   Diagnosed and fixed a critical logging failure (`KeyError: 'session_id'`) caused by a race condition with the `litellm` library. Implemented a targeted fix in `plugins/tool_llm.py` to inject the required `SessionIdFilter` into the root logger during the plugin's setup, making the system resilient to logging from external libraries.
*   Addressed a second logging flaw within the `FileSystemTool` by refactoring its methods (`read_file`, `write_file`, etc.) to accept the `SharedContext` and use the correct session-specific logger.
*   Solved a planner failure where the LLM was hallucinating incorrect method names (e.g., `write` instead of `write_file`). Modified the `CognitivePlanner` to dynamically include a detailed list of available methods for each tool in its prompt, providing the LLM with the necessary context to generate valid plans.
*   After implementing these fixes, successfully executed the 8-step programming benchmark three times in a row, confirming the stability and robustness of the improved architecture.

**3. Outcome:**
*   The mission was completed successfully. The system's reliability has been significantly enhanced, and it is now capable of executing complex, multi-step programming benchmarks without failure. The architectural improvements to the logging and planning systems have proven effective.
